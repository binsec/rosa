# Installation
There are multiple different ways to install ROSA. The recommended way is to [use ROSA in a Docker
container](./installation/using_docker.md) to avoid the hassle of dealing with dependencies
(including the fuzzer that will be used by ROSA).

Alternatively, ROSA can be [built from source](./installation/building_from_source.md).
