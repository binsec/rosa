- Check output directory
    - Most notably, make sure that the names of the files/traces/etc check out

- Add READMEs to the various output directories
    - Kinda like AFL++, to explain how to interpret each one.

- Make sure to pick up traces for ALL inputs (AFL++-centric stuff):
    - Something to do with `out/default/_resume`?
    - Something to do with the log message "Loaded a total of X seeds"?

- Add a "discriminator mode":
    - This is mostly for analysis. It would be nice to have some way of telling which
      discriminators (i.e. edges/syscalls) caused a trace to be flagged as (non-)backdoor.
